# tempEnergyDemandModelling

Here is all our code for our temperature and energy demand modelling project for ADS1002: 

all_demand_data.csv -> all the demand data from 2013-2019 from VIC 
weatherData.csv -> all weather data from BoM's Automatic Weather Station at Olympic Park from 2013-2020
tempDemand.csv -> temperature and demand data combined into one dataset
